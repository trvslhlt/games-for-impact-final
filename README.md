# Sex Ed Project

## Getting Started

This portion of the project is being managed as a git repo. Git is a tool that makes it possible to make checkpoints without creating a bunch of new files and folders all over the place. You can also safely go back to an earlier stage in the project if things get out of wack.

1. Open Terminal.
1. Enter `which git`. If there is no output for this command then you need to install git. There are many ways to do this - most of them painless. Here is an [example tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
1. Navigate to a directory where you want the project to live on your computer. (`cd ~/Desktop` will bring you to your desktop).
1. Enter `git clone https://github.com/trvslhlt/games-for-impact-final` to download a copy of the repo to your computer. You should now see all the project files in a folder on your Desktop.
